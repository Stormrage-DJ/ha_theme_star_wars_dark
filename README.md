Created by [Tim Cowell](https://github.com/tgcowell) for Home Assistant
This theme is a mixture of themes that I liked but wanted to adjust slightly to the design, look and feel I wanted. 

These themes include

* Noctis - https://github.com/aFFekopp/noctis

* Caule Theme Pack - https://github.com/orickcorreia/caule-themes-pack-1

I plan on continuing to develop this theme and would like to include light/dark for theme automations.
